help me write a simple flask app that does the following:

Frontend:

Designed to be viewed on mobile. Consists of a large textarea with a submit button, 
that submit the text to a server at an endpoint, /run. On iPhone, the textarea should
have voice input available on the keyboard (I think this will be by default).

Backend:

An endpoint, /, that returns the page described above.
An endpoint, /run, which calls custom code that will call the function run_command(text: str),
where text is the value of the textarea, encoded in a post request.
