Help me write a g4 file for the following language, Spock, which is designed to be spoken aloud. It has no punctuation, only words. it is case insensitive, and whitespace insensitive:

```
program : statement+
statement : declaration | assignment | PRINT expression | block ; // Is a declaration a type of assignment? I don't know
block: BEGIN statement+ END
declaration : DECLARE ID ;
type : FUN, INT, STR ;
assignment : ID EQUALS expression ;
expression : ID | STRING | NUMBER | lambda ;
lambda : LAMBDA TAKES list AND DOES block
list : BEGIN ID+ END


// Lexer rules -- these are regexes, meaning the words are just equivalent to themselves
DECLARE : declare ;
ID : [a-zA-Z]+ ;
FUN : function ;
INT : integer ;
STR : string ;
EQUALS : equals ;
STRING : quote \w+ unquote ;
NUMBER : \d+ ;
LAMBDA : lambda
TAKES : takes ;
AND : and ;
DOES : does ;
BEGIN : begin ;
END : end ;
```
