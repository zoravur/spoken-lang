define fibonacci recursive as lambda takes n does begin
    if call equal with n and zero return zero
    if call equal with n and one return one
    return call sum with
        call fibonacci recursive with
            call difference left n and 1 right
        and 
        call fibonacci recursive with
            call difference with n and 2
finish
print call fibonacci recursive with 3
