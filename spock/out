define sum of multiples as lambda takes
limit and
divisor does begin
define m as
call quotient with
limit and divisor
define total as 0
while
m begin set total as call
sum with
total and
call product
with m and
divisor set m as call difference
with m and
1
finish
return total

define total as call sum of multiples with
1001 and 3 set total as call sum
with total and
call sum of multiples
with 1001 and
5
set total
as call difference
with total and
call sum of multiples
